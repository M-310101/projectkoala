Five women killed in stretch limousine fire in San Francisco

Five women have died and four others were injured after a stretch limousine caught fire.

Only the male driver escaped completely unharmed when the limo became engulfed in flames as it crossed the San Mateo bridge in the San Francisco Bay area in the US.

Three of the female passengers were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation, while one has sustained severe burns. All the women are thought to be in their 30s but their names are being withheld until their next of kin have been informed.

‘We have no idea right now where they were going or where they were coming from,’ California highway patrol officer Amelia Jack told KGO-TV.

It is not known what caused the fire to break out, but amateur video footage shows the limo ablaze on the bridge, 20 miles south-east of San Francisco, last night.

Stretch limos are normally hired for celebrations such as proms, stag or hen dos.
