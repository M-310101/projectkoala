Bronze Age houses uncovered in Cambridgeshire are Britain's 'Pompeii'

Archaeologists say they have uncovered Britain's "Pompeii" after discovering the "best-preserved Bronze Age dwellings ever found" in the country.

The circular wooden houses, built on stilts, form part of a settlement at Must Farm quarry, in Cambridgeshire, and date to about 1000-800 BC.

A fire destroyed the posts, causing the houses to fall into a river where silt helped preserve the contents.

Pots with meals still inside have been found at the site.

An earlier test trench at the site, near Whittlesey, revealed small cups, bowls and jars.

In addition, archaeologists said "exotic" glass beads that formed part of a necklace "hinted at a sophistication not usually associated with the Bronze Age".

Textiles made from plant fibres such as lime tree bark have also been unearthed.

However, the roundhouses themselves are now being excavated.

Archaeologists think they have found about five houses but are not yet certain.
