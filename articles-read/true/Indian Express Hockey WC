Australia beat Germany 2-1 to win Hockey WC

Australia shattered Germany's dream of registering the first hat-trick of world titles in the history of the game, beating the double defending champions 2-1 in the summit clash of the Hero Honda FIH World Cup.

With this win, the Aussies have not only avenged their defeats in the last two editions of the tournament but also clinched their second world title.

For Australia, Edward Ockenden scored the first goal in the sixth minute while Luke Doerner converted a penalty corner in the 59th minute to become the top-scorer of the tournament along with Dutchman Taeke Taekema with eight goals apiece.

Moritz Furste scored the lone goal for the Germans in the 47th minute.

The Aussies had earlier won the title way back in 1986 in London but lost out in the finals against Germany in the last two World Cup finals in Kuala Lumpur (2002) and Monchengladbach, Germany (2006).

Incidentally, with this victory Australia coach Ric Charlesworth have achieved a rare feat in the history of the game. He became only the second player after the Netherlands' Hants Jorritsma to have won the World Cup both as a coach and a player.

With revenge in mind, the Australians came out with a purpose and from the onset applied pressure on the German goal.
