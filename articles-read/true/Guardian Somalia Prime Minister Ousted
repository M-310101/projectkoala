Somalia's prime minister and cabinet ousted

Somali politicians have voted 184-65 to oust the prime minister and his cabinet after 14 months in office. Abdi Farah Shirdon would remain in office until the president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, nominated a new prime minister, who would have 30 days to appoint a cabinet, the parliamentary speaker, Sheik Osman Jawari Jawari, said.

The vote came after disputes emerged between Shirdon, a former businessman, and Mohamud. Politicians said Shirdon had refused to include the president's choices in his cabinet.

The UN representative to Somalia, Nicholas Kay, said the rejection of the prime minister by vote from the parliament showed that Somalia's institutions were coming of age. "The UN is here to support their development, and looks forward to working constructively with the new administration. Outgoing Prime Minister Shirdon had worked hard to promote growth and progress and played an important part in creating the New Deal Compact between international partners and Somalia," Kay said.

The government is in place largely thanks to African Union troops, and controls only small parts of the country and continues to struggle to provide security and battle corruption. The capital, Mogadishu, though, is much better off today than the years 2006-2011, when the militant group al-Shabab controlled much of the capital.
